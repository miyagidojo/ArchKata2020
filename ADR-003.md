# Usage of queues

## Status
*NEEDS REFINEMENT*

## Context
In general, food delivery applications provide inmediate feedback regarding the status of the order, even tracking the coordinates of the delivery. 
It could be expected from users the same UX.

It is our understanding that the application only offers dishes already available at a point-of-sale, thus:
- The app could connect to a "maps" application to provide the directions to get there.
- Notify of ahead-of-time orders has been delivered.

## Decision
With the current information we consider queues are not required. Not even the kitchens and point-of-sales, since it is of little benefit to see in real-time their sold stock. Kitchens plans the ingredient stock with days in advance.

## Consequences
Unless our understating of the business model is wrong, this should not have consecuences until the business model is extended to match something just-in-time cooking and/or home delivery.
