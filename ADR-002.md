# dBs: Type and Ownership.

## Status
_ACCEPTED_

## Context
4 kind of actors are identified (Customers, Kitchens, Point of Sales and the Core System). Each one with different sets of data. 

It is assumed that "Customers Data" > "Kitchen Data" > "Point-of-Sale Data".  

## Decision

- Customer:
  - **[SQL]** Account Data (Name, Address(es), Contact Info, Credit Cards, Suscription, etc)
  - **[SQL]** Health/Diet Data
  - **[SQL]** Purchase History
- Kitchen:
  - **[SQL]** Account Data (Name, Address(es), Contact Info, Users & account data for each of them)
  - **[SQL]** Ingredients stock
  - **[NoSQL-> Document Store]** Quantitative Recipes
  - **[SQL]** Menu status (Dishes and their status: Scheduled, Cooking, Ready, Delivered, etc)
  - **[NoSQL-> Document Store]** Feedback
- Point-of-Sales:
  - **[SQL]** Account Data (Kiosk or independent SmartFridge, SmartFridges State, Adress, etc)
  - **[NoSQL-> Document Store]** Feedback
- Core System (in charge of processing customer's order, including payments and promotions/coupons):
  - **[More refinement is needed]** Coupons/Promotions
  - **[NoSQL-> In Memory Key-Value Store]** User Selections

Items labeled as **SQL** are considered mature (accounts) or simple (ingredients) enough to know they fit a row-oriented database and should not require major changes (add/remove fields) in their lifetime.
Items labeled as **NoSQL -> Document Store** are those that the data model its not mature enough to have in a SQL dB or data is affine to natural language.
Items labeled as **NoSQL-> In Memory Key-Value Store** are those which persistence is not essential, data loss can be easily recovered, data is transient and/or can be used a cache to speed-up internal processing.

## Consequences
We understand there is a risk going with SQL in such early stage but for the same reason we believe it can be easily corrected.
Also, having 3 types of dBs in the cloud can be prohibitive, in such case, we recommend discarding SQL and key-value store dBs, and only use Document Store type dB.
