# Actors need & db Type

## Status
*ACCEPTED*

## Context
4 kind of actors are identified (Customers, Kitchens, Point of Sales and the Core System). Each one with different needs and sets of data. 

We work following the next premises:
- Amount & Grow: rate Customers Data > Kitchen Data > Point-of-Sale Data.
- Operations over

## Decision

- Customer:
  - **[SQL]** Account Data (Name, Address(es), Contact Info, Credit Cards, Suscription, etc)
  - **[SQL]** Health/Diet Data
  - **[SQL]** Purchase History
- Kitchen:
  - **[SQL]** Account Data (Name, Address(es), Contact Info, Users & account data for each of them)
  - **[SQL]** Ingredients stock
  - **[NoSQL-> Document Store]** Quantitative Recipes
  - **[SQL]** Menu status (Dishes and their status: Scheduled, Cooking, Ready, Delivered, etc)
  - **[NoSQL-> Document Store]** Feedback
- Point-of-Sales:
  - **[SQL]** Account Data (Kiosk or independent SmartFridge, SmartFridges State, Adress, etc)
  - **[NoSQL-> Document Store]** Feedback
- Core System (in charge of processing customer's order, including payments and promotions/coupons):
  - **[SQL]** Account for PharmacyFoods Admins & Accounting.
  - **[NoSQL-> Document Store]** Coupons/Promotions (but we believe more refinement is needed)
  - **[NoSQL-> In Memory Key-Value Store]** User Selections
  - **[NoSQL-> In Memory Key-Value Store]** Session Profile

Items labeled as **SQL** are considered mature (accounts) or simple (ingredients) enough to know they fit a row-oriented database and should not require major changes (add/remove fields) in their lifetime.

Items labeled as **NoSQL -> Document Store** are those that the data model its not mature enough to have in a SQL dB or data is affine to natural language.

Items labeled as **NoSQL-> In Memory Key-Value Store** are those which persistence is not essential, data loss can be easily recovered, data is transient and/or can be used a cache to speed-up internal processing.

For security concerns, **Customer Data** goes on a separate physical dB.

## Consequences
We understand there is a risk going with SQL in such early stage but for the same reason we believe it can be easily corrected.
Also, having 3 types of dBs or physcally different of the same type in the cloud can be prohibitive, in such case, we recommend discarding SQL and key-value store dBs, and only use Document Store type dB but keeping one phisically separate for customers data. This is also because of performance issues because to build the session profile that handles user's permits, the core has to query the user account data.
