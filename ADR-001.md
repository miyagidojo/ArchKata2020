# Definition of Architecture Style

## Status
_ACCEPTED_

## Context
PharmacyFoods is a nascent start-up with limited cash and rising user base. There are multiple actors in their business model and future plans: 2 types of customers, Kitchen, 3rd party kitchens, SmartFridges, kiosks, health monitor, etc. It's reach is limited to one city (Detroit) with plans to expand across the state and neighbor states. Also, given it just starting, its business models and actors can completely change in one day, thus domain partitioning is desirable in order to not affect the order components.
## Decision
Tha architects have defined the following driving characteristics for the overall architecture: _cost_, _adaptability_ and _extensability_, with _security_ a closed forth since the company will be storing personal health info.

## Consequences
