# Definition of Architecture Style

## Status
_ACCEPTED_

## Context
PharmacyFoods is a nascent start-up with limited cash and rising user base. There are multiple actors in their business model and future plans: 2 types of customers, Kitchen, 3rd party kitchens, SmartFridges, kiosks, health monitor, etc. It's reach is limited to one city (Detroit) with plans to expand across the state and neighbor states. Also, given it just starting, its business models and actors can completely change in one day, thus domain partitioning is desirable in order to not affect the order components.
## Decision
Tha architects have defined the following driving characteristics for the overall architecture: _cost_, _adaptability_ and _extensability_, with _security_ a closed forth since the company will be storing personal health info. Because of this, we believe a Service Based Architecture is the best solution. 
This business is just beginning so money is limited (_cost_) but also its model it's not fully defined (this is reflected in the Q&A from the first session and the quality of the docs). Thus the need for _adaptability_. Finally, this business is actually geographically expanding, adding more fridges and point-of-sale and is considering the inclusion of 3rd party kitchen, so the need for _extensability_.

As expressed during the Q&A eventually the would start gathering personal health info, which is very sensible, so _security_ should be easy to increase when required (beyond a level of security required by a regular purchase service).

## Consequences
While, in general terms, this architecture _scales_ relativitely well, the need for scalability will depend on the success of the business. This architecture also suffers from being less _elastic_, but we don't believe this will an issue soon. It is true that most people eat around the same time, so a rush in demand, but since the business plan considers working through suscription and offering what is available in the fridges, countermeasures can be taken, like ahead-of-time ordering.
